Module 3 Challenge

	The overall idea behind the Module 3 Challenge is to write code that will effectively make the information easier for the election team to read.  This in return will allow for more clear and concise estimates such as what county had the largest turnout, or percentages for how well each politician did.  These estimates can be useful for elections down the road.

	The following bullet points are an overview of the information pulled by the program:
- There were a total of 369,711 votes. 
- Jefferson County had a total of (38,855) votes , Denver County had a total of (306,055) votes , and Arapahoe County had a total of (24,801) votes.
- This txt_file is complete with percentages of achieved by each county out of the given total votes category.  Jefferson (10.5%) , Denver (82.8%) , Arapahoe (6.7%).
- Denver had the largest number of votes.
- Out of the total number of votes (369,711) , Charles Casper Stockham took 23% (85,213) , Diana Degette took 73.8% (272,892) , and Raymon Anthony Doane 3.1% (11,606.)
- Diana Degette won the election.  She had a total of 272,892 votes, and a percentage of 73.8% of the collective votes.

	Collecting data, especially on a massive scale such as a congressional election, is time consuming, and can often be skewed by wrong counts that would otherwise take months to discover ruined the data.  With this program, you could plug different politicians, and even counties in each election and make your job easier, saving hundreds of man hours.  You could even use it to take polls or petition counts.  Letâ€™s say you wanted to try and pass a bill that would allow kids to have less homework, and a mandatory hour long recess.  This program is suited extremely well for that purpose.  This program, makes it faster to get numbers, and store them so your bill could pass even faster.  Less time, and a more accurate description of peoples views.
